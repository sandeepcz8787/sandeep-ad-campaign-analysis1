üìä Facebook Ad Campaign Funnel Analysis ‚Äì by Sandeep Chavhan
üîç Overview
This project analyzes a real-world Facebook ad campaign dataset to uncover trends in user engagement and campaign performance. I used Python, SQL concepts, and Power BI to calculate and visualize key advertising metrics like CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, and ROAS.

üéØ Objectives
Understand user behavior across different age and gender groups

Identify high- and low-performing ad segments

Recommend actionable strategies to improve campaign ROI

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and segment analysis

SQL logic: For calculating metrics like CTR and conversions

üìà Key Metrics Calculated
Click-Through Rate (CTR) = Clicks / Impressions

Cost Per Click (CPC) = Spent / Clicks

Conversion Rate = Conversions / Clicks

ROAS (assumed) = Revenue / Spend (using assumed revenue per conversion)

üí° Insights
Users aged 30‚Äì34 had the highest CTR across both genders

Conversion rate was lower for higher spend segments, indicating optimization issues

Suggested retargeting younger users with new creatives to reduce CPC and improve ROAS

üìä Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes:

Campaign performance summary

CTR and conversion trends by demographic

Ad spend efficiency insights
